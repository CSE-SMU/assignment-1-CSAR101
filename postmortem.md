# Assignment 1 Postmortem

## What's your past experience with front-end development?

I've worked with Wordpress before and had exposure to JavaScript from previous courses. Also have experience with UI/UX for mobile apps, mainly for the startup I am a part of.

## How difficult was this assignment?

Very difficult (joking).

## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?

Did not know GitHub had a classroom feature, pretty neat. 

## How could this assignment be improved?

Add more components alongside the button requirement.

## Any other comments?

Looking forward to expanding my knowledge of GUI and it's design principles so that I can incorporate what I learn to what I do everyday, designing apps!
